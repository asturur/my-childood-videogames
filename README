# Old MSDOS game collection

This is the collection of games i had in my first home computer when i was a kid.

While the commodore 64 looked like way better, and games looked like smoother and more fun, i had this PC IBM XT compatible with an 8088 and 512kb of ram.

Definitely this was for me what started my interest in computer and programming.

The repo contains a simple index.html, a copy of js-dos and some simple code to run the games one at time.
